IDEA FOR CODEFUNDO

--> We are planning to build a web app that would help the locals to fight the situations of natural disaster.As, we know that in remote places where the technology has not reached to that level, there we could have some volunteers that would help them in these situations.

--> This web app would consist of two parts ==> 

		1. First for the prediction part. As, we know that major loss occur because people didnt knew that something is coming.So, if they knew before they could do some things that would atleast help in saving a lot of people.By our app people would get to know about the weather conditions, warnings and changes in the climate. Also, our app would have some basic steps of what to do in the natural disaster situations,like tsunami,earthquake,etc.

		2. Second part is the management part.In case of occurence of a natural disaster, then our app will help the volunteers by giving the actual idea of the situtation(collected by our app through local people there).By this the volunteers would know what is the people need , how to save them, proper distribution of resources and food. Thus maximising the efforts of resuce, and ultimately saving resources.
--> Anyone having internet access can open this web app.It is not neccessary that all the people should have internet 	  access. As, if any person from the community has, he can inform others about it and the people would take the 		corresponding decision by unity and wisely also. This app would just people the right way of what to do in 			emergency situations and how to handle them effectively.

--> Firstly, we will start this web app from a small place. We will collect data about the terrain,people living there and accordingly methods would be given. We will use the standard procedures but with great care as they vary according to the people and the place where they are living.Basically, our dataset would vary from region to region. As, some places would be earthquake prone,some tsunami prone, etc. So, every one would have different needs.So, our app would take care of that.We would store the location, region, needs, disasters that could occur. And corresponding to each disaster only the people would get notified. So, people would get only those warnings that could impact them. Thus, the app would work differently for different regions according to their needs.

--> The technology we would use are -
		1. Weather Forcasting
		2. Maps
		3. Microsoft Azure for web developing
